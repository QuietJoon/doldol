This really works in some cases.

A simulation uses a function which works as same as `anyReq` to find any intersect element in two given Enum list. There are two Enum types which have 3 or 6 elements.
The implementation of the function is recursive function.
At first time, the function is replaced with a `if` and `not . exclude` when there is no `anyReq` function.
The result shows that the library reduced about 6% of elapsed time at the simulation.
